# Enable Firebase Authentication - Step by Step

## Option 1: Visual Guide (Easiest)

### Step 1: Open the Authentication Page
I've already opened this in your browser, but if you need it again:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/plank-challenge-app-2026/authentication

### Step 2: Look for the "Get Started" Button
- You should see a page titled "Authentication"
- There will be a big blue button that says **"Get started"**
- Click it

### Step 3: You'll See a List of Sign-in Providers
After clicking "Get started", you'll see options like:
- Email/Password
- Phone
- Google
- Facebook
- etc.

### Step 4: Enable Email/Password
1. Find **"Email/Password"** (should be first or second in the list)
2. Click on it (the whole row is clickable)
3. A dialog/panel will open on the right side
4. You'll see a toggle switch that says **"Enable"**
5. Click the toggle to turn it ON (it will turn blue)
6. Click the **"Save"** button at the bottom

### Step 5: Done!
You should see "Email/Password" now shows as "Enabled" in the providers list.

## Option 2: If You Don't See "Get Started"

If Authentication is already initialized, you might see a different screen:

1. Look for a tab called **"Sign-in method"** at the top
2. Click on **"Sign-in method"**
3. Under "Sign-in providers", find **"Email/Password"**
4. Click on **"Email/Password"**
5. Toggle **"Enable"** to ON
6. Click **"Save"**

## Option 3: Direct Link Method

Click this exact link:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/plank-challenge-app-2026/authentication/providers

This takes you directly to the providers page.

## What You Should See After Success

After enabling, you should see:
- Email/Password: **Enabled** ✓
- Status: Active

## Still Stuck?

Tell me what you see on your screen:
1. Do you see a "Get started" button?
2. Do you see "Sign-in method" tab?
3. Do you see a list of providers?
4. What does the page look like?

I'll help you from there!
